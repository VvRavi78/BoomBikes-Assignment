# Predicting demand for BoomBikes Bike-Sharing 
> Need to create a model the predicts the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demand vary with different features. They can accordingly change the business strategy to meet the demand levels and exceed customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a bike sharing market.

  A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
